			<p>In this part, you will hear three talks, or lectures. The talks or lectures will be played once only. There are five questions for each talk or lecture.<br>
For each question, choose the right answer, A, B, C, or D. Part 3. Questions 21 to 25. First, you will have some time to look at questions 21 to 25. Now we're ready to start.<br>
Listen, and answer questions 21 to 25. You will hear the recording once only. The Statue of Liberty may be one of the biggest presents in history.<br>
In 1886, France gave the United States a huge statue. It is a woman holding a torch high in the air. The torch is a symbol of freedom.<br>
The gift was given to remember the important friendship between the two countries. One hundred years earlier, France had helped America in its war for freedom from Britain. A French sculptor was chosen to design the statue.<br>
It was a very difficult job because of its size. He decided to make her skin out of thin copper sheets. Then he would attach them to a metal frame.<br>
He asked an engineer to design and build the huge frame. That engineer's name was Gustave Eiffel. He would later build the famous Eiffel Tower in Paris, France.<br>
The statue was too big to fit on a ship. So, it was reduced to 350 pieces and taken to America in many separate boxes. The builders chose a small island in New York Harbor as the place to put the statue.<br>
The statue was a gift. However, the U.S. needed to build a base for her to stand on. People from all over America sent money to help build it.<br>
The base was finished in the spring of 1886. They began to put the pieces of the statue together. When the statue was finished, it was the tallest structure in America.<br>
She stands over 46 meters high. Just one of her fingers is 2.4 meters long. The statue faces the ocean to welcome ships as they sail into New York.<br>
Each year, thousands of visitors come to the island to see her. They can even climb the 354 steps up into her crown and look out the windows. She is a symbol of freedom for people all over the world.<br>
After all, it's in her name. The word liberty means freedom. Now you will have some time to review questions 21 to 25.<br>
Part 3. Questions 26 to 30. First, you will have some time to look at questions 26 to 30. <br>
What do a bicycle, a chair, a house, and a T-shirt have in common? They can all be made using bamboo.<br>
Bamboo is one of the most amazing plants on Earth. It has been used by humans for thousands of years. Bamboo may also be one of the most important plants of the future.<br>
Bamboo is very strong. It can be used in most of the same ways as wood. Many kinds of bamboo are actually harder than wood.<br>
People all over the world have built houses with bamboo. Bamboo has other uses as well. It makes strong and beautiful furniture.<br>
As the young bamboo plants grow, they can be formed into different shapes like circles and even squares. Clothes made from bamboo are quite soft. They are also very good at stopping bad smells.<br>
Some companies are even making bicycles with bamboo instead of metal tubes. Even though bamboo looks like a tree, it's actually a kind of grass. It's related to plants like corn and rice.<br>
Bamboo is one of the fastest growing plants in the world. It can grow about 3 centimeters per hour. Trees take much longer to grow, of course.<br>
It takes 20 years or more for a tree to grow to a useful size. Bamboo reaches its useful size in only 3 to 7 years. Many bamboo plants can grow in the same time as one tree.<br>
This makes a bamboo farm more efficient than a tree farm. The population of the world grows every year. That means that there is more need for materials like wood.<br>
But the number of trees is limited. If people used bamboo instead, many trees could be saved. Scientists and inventors are working hard to find other uses for this amazing plant.<br>
Now you will have some time to review questions 26 to 30. Part 3. Questions 31 to 35. First, you will have some time to look at questions 31 to 35.<br>
Okay, everyone. If you'd like to come over here to our next exhibit. Okay, so we're continuing to learn about the history of the home computer.<br>
Now, does anyone recognize this amazing machine? No? Well, anyone who grew up in Britain in the 1980s would immediately recognize this. It's the famous BBC microcomputer. You've all heard of the BBC, right? The British Broadcasting Corporation, or BBC, is Britain's national state-run television and radio network.<br>
So why did a TV station make a computer? That's a really interesting story. It starts in the early 1980s. BBC television showed a program called the Mighty Micro, in which a professor, his name was Dr. Christopher Evans, he predicted the importance of the microcomputer, what we today just call the computer or the personal computer.<br>
Now, you have to remember that in 1980, there were no computers in homes, in schools, in libraries. Computers were big and expensive, so they still weren't something that a family or a student would go out and buy. But Dr. Evans made a prediction, a guess about the future.<br>
He predicted that computers were going to get smaller. Technology was making it possible to build a whole computer in a box that could fit on your desk. That's why the first home computers were called microcomputers.<br>
Micro, meaning small. Okay, so Evans argued that the microcomputer was going to change everything, and that Britain's children needed to learn how to use a computer in order to be prepared for the future. Now, it just so happened that a lot of important people watched that program, and Evans' predictions caught the attention of many people in Britain.<br>
In fact, even the British Parliament, the government, ended up discussing the program and Evans' predictions. So the BBC decided to start a new project to build a computer that was affordable, but that had lots of functions. Text, graphics, sound, music, programming, even artificial intelligence.<br>
The BBC planned to sell its microcomputer to homes and especially schools around the country. So the BBC made the actual computer? No, actually they didn't. The BBC was, and still is, in the business of making television and radio programs, not computers.<br>
So they wanted to find a computer company that could make the computer and put the BBC's name on it. In Cambridge, England, home to the famous old university, a small company called Acorn heard about the project. It just so happened that Acorn was already making its first computer, but it wasn't quite finished yet.<br>
The Acorn employees worked through the night and finished that first computer. It was called the Proton. They showed their brand new creation to the BBC and won the contract.<br>
It's really an amazing story of a small company beating all the bigger corporations. The first BBC computer, they called it the Model A, came out in 1981. And the Model B came out not too long afterward.<br>
And that's the computer you can see here. The BBC Model B microcomputer. The computer was an immediate success, mainly because schools in Britain bought many of them to teach computer skills to students.<br>
Excuse me, what could you do with a computer? <br>
Now you will have some time to review questions 31 to 35. That is the end of Part 3. That is the end of the Listening Comprehension Test.</p>

			<p>Phần 3 Trong phần này, bạn sẽ nghe ba bài nói hoặc bài giảng. Các bài nói hoặc bài giảng sẽ chỉ được phát một lần duy nhất. Mỗi bài nói hoặc bài giảng có năm câu hỏi đi kèm. Với mỗi câu hỏi, hãy chọn đáp án đúng A, B, C hoặc D. Phần 3, câu hỏi 21-25 Trước tiên, bạn sẽ có một chút thời gian để xem các câu hỏi từ 21 đến 25. Bây giờ, chúng ta sẵn sàng bắt đầu. Hãy lắng nghe và trả lời các câu hỏi từ 21 đến 25. Bạn sẽ chỉ nghe đoạn ghi âm một lần duy nhất. Tượng Nữ thần Tự do có thể là một trong những món quà lớn nhất trong lịch sử. Năm 1886, Pháp đã tặng Hoa Kỳ một bức tượng khổng lồ. Đó là hình ảnh một người phụ nữ cầm ngọn đuốc giơ cao trên không trung. Ngọn đuốc là biểu tượng của tự do. Món quà này được trao để kỷ niệm tình hữu nghị quan trọng giữa hai quốc gia. Một trăm năm trước đó, Pháp đã giúp Mỹ trong cuộc chiến giành độc lập khỏi Anh. Một nhà điêu khắc người Pháp đã được chọn để thiết kế bức tượng. Đó là một công việc rất khó khăn vì kích thước khổng lồ của nó. Ông quyết định làm lớp vỏ ngoài của tượng bằng các tấm đồng mỏng, sau đó gắn chúng vào một khung kim loại. Ông đã nhờ một kỹ sư thiết kế và xây dựng bộ khung khổng lồ. Tên của kỹ sư đó là Gustave Eiffel. Sau này, ông chính là người đã xây dựng Tháp Eiffel nổi tiếng ở Paris, Pháp. Bức tượng quá lớn để có thể vận chuyển bằng tàu. Vì vậy, nó đã được tháo thành 350 mảnh và được đưa đến Mỹ trong nhiều thùng hàng riêng biệt. Các nhà xây dựng đã chọn một hòn đảo nhỏ trong cảng New York để đặt bức tượng. Bức tượng là một món quà. Tuy nhiên, Hoa Kỳ cần xây dựng một bệ đỡ để tượng đứng lên. Người dân khắp nước Mỹ đã gửi tiền để giúp xây dựng bệ đỡ này. Phần bệ đỡ đã được hoàn thành vào mùa xuân năm 1886. Sau đó, họ bắt đầu lắp ráp các mảnh của bức tượng. Khi bức tượng hoàn thành, nó trở thành công trình cao nhất ở Mỹ. Tượng cao hơn 46 mét. Chỉ riêng một ngón tay của bức tượng đã dài 2,4 mét. Tượng hướng ra biển để chào đón các con tàu khi chúng cập cảng New York. Mỗi năm, hàng nghìn du khách đến hòn đảo này để chiêm ngưỡng bức tượng. Họ thậm chí có thể leo lên 354 bậc thang để vào trong vương miện của bức tượng và nhìn qua các cửa sổ. Bức tượng là biểu tượng của tự do đối với mọi người trên thế giới. Sau tất cả, điều đó đã nằm trong tên của nó. Từ "liberty" có nghĩa là tự do. Bây giờ bạn sẽ có một chút thời gian để xem lại các câu hỏi từ 21 đến 25. Phần 3, câu hỏi 26-30 Trước tiên, bạn sẽ có một chút thời gian để xem các câu hỏi từ 26 đến 30. Xe đạp, ghế, nhà và áo thun có điểm gì chung? Chúng đều có thể được làm từ tre. Tre là một trong những loài thực vật đáng kinh ngạc nhất trên Trái Đất. Nó đã được con người sử dụng trong hàng nghìn năm. Tre cũng có thể là một trong những loài thực vật quan trọng nhất của tương lai. Tre rất bền. Nó có thể được sử dụng giống như gỗ. Nhiều loại tre thậm chí còn cứng hơn gỗ. Người ta trên khắp thế giới đã xây nhà bằng tre. Tre còn có nhiều công dụng khác. Nó tạo ra những món đồ nội thất đẹp và chắc chắn. Khi cây tre non phát triển, chúng có thể được uốn thành nhiều hình dạng khác nhau như hình tròn hay hình vuông. Quần áo làm từ tre rất mềm mại. Chúng cũng có khả năng khử mùi rất tốt. Một số công ty thậm chí đang sản xuất xe đạp từ tre thay vì sử dụng ống kim loại. Mặc dù trông giống như một loại cây, nhưng thực ra tre là một loại cỏ. Nó có họ hàng với các loài thực vật như ngô và lúa. Tre là một trong những loài thực vật phát triển nhanh nhất thế giới. Nó có thể phát triển khoảng 3 cm mỗi giờ. Trong khi đó, cây gỗ cần nhiều thời gian hơn để phát triển. Phải mất ít nhất 20 năm để một cái cây đạt kích thước sử dụng được. Trong khi đó, tre chỉ cần 3 đến 7 năm để đạt kích thước tương tự. Nhiều cây tre có thể phát triển trong cùng thời gian mà một cái cây mất để trưởng thành. Điều này khiến việc trồng tre hiệu quả hơn nhiều so với trồng cây gỗ. Dân số thế giới ngày càng tăng đồng nghĩa với việc nhu cầu về gỗ cũng tăng lên. Nhưng số lượng cây gỗ có hạn. Nếu con người sử dụng tre thay thế, nhiều cây gỗ có thể được bảo tồn. Các nhà khoa học và nhà phát minh đang nỗ lực tìm ra những công dụng khác của loại cây tuyệt vời này. Bây giờ bạn sẽ có một chút thời gian để xem lại các câu hỏi từ 26 đến 30. Phần 3, câu hỏi 31-35 Trước tiên, bạn sẽ có một chút thời gian để xem các câu hỏi từ 31 đến 35. Được rồi, mọi người. Nếu các bạn đi về phía này, chúng ta sẽ tiếp tục tìm hiểu về lịch sử của máy tính cá nhân. Có ai nhận ra chiếc máy đáng kinh ngạc này không? Không ư? Bất kỳ ai lớn lên ở Anh trong những năm 1980 chắc chắn sẽ nhận ra chiếc máy tính này ngay lập tức. Đây chính là chiếc máy tính nổi tiếng BBC Micro. Chắc hẳn các bạn đã nghe nói đến BBC rồi, đúng không? British Broadcasting Corporation, hay BBC, là đài phát thanh và truyền hình quốc gia của Anh. Vậy tại sao một đài truyền hình lại làm ra một chiếc máy tính? Đó là một câu chuyện rất thú vị. Vào đầu những năm 1980, BBC phát sóng một chương trình có tên là The Mighty Micro. Trong đó, một giáo sư tên là Tiến sĩ Christopher Evans đã dự đoán về tầm quan trọng của máy vi tính, thứ mà ngày nay chúng ta gọi đơn giản là máy tính cá nhân. Thời điểm đó, vào năm 1980, không có máy tính trong gia đình, trường học hay thư viện. Máy tính vẫn còn to và đắt đỏ, vì vậy không ai mua chúng cho mục đích cá nhân. Nhưng Tiến sĩ Evans đã đưa ra một dự đoán: ông tin rằng công nghệ sẽ giúp máy tính nhỏ hơn và có thể đặt vừa trên bàn làm việc. Đó là lý do những chiếc máy tính gia đình đầu tiên được gọi là microcomputer - nghĩa là máy tính nhỏ. Dự đoán của ông đã thu hút sự chú ý của nhiều người, thậm chí cả Quốc hội Anh. BBC quyết định tài trợ cho một dự án phát triển máy tính có giá cả phải chăng nhưng vẫn đầy đủ tính năng. BBC không tự làm máy tính, mà tìm một công ty có thể chế tạo nó. Một công ty nhỏ tên Acorn ở Cambridge đã giành được hợp đồng. Chiếc máy tính đầu tiên của BBC, Model A, ra mắt năm 1981, và Model B được giới thiệu sau đó. Nó nhanh chóng trở thành lựa chọn phổ biến trong các trường học ở Anh. Bây giờ bạn sẽ có một chút thời gian để xem lại các câu hỏi từ 31 đến 35. Đây là phần kết thúc của Phần 3. Đây là phần kết thúc của bài kiểm tra nghe hiểu.</p>
