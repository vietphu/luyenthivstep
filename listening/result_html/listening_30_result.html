		<p>Part 3 In this part, you will hear three talks, or lectures. The talks or lectures will be played once only. There are five questions for each talk or lecture.<br>
For each question, choose the right answer, A, B, C, or D. Part 3 Questions 21 to 25 First, you will have some time to look at questions 21 to 25. Now we're ready to start. Listen and answer questions 21 to 25.<br>
You will hear the recording once only. School days are supposed to be the best days of your life, and part of that experience usually involves some strenuous physical activity. I asked some colleagues to give me their recollections of what happened to them on the sports field, and beyond, and this is what they told me.<br>
Cup Winners When I was about ten, my friend Steve told me, the football team from our year inexplicably made it to the cup final of the local school's league. I say inexplicably because I only remember us losing nearly every match we played. Anyway, in the final I set up the winning goal, a brilliant cross to my mate David, who headed the ball in just before the final whistle.<br>
I still have a photograph of the team holding the cup. Forest Hike Thomas said, I remember having to lead a group of eight boys on a school expedition for the best part of two days when I was a teenager. Even though we got lost at one point, I managed to keep them all together and got them from one end of a large forest to the other and back by sheer force of will.<br>
I was chosen to be the leader, I think, because I was the only one who knew how to read a map. When we arrived back at the campsite, we found out that all the other groups had cheated and hitched most of the way instead. I felt a bit of a mug, but also rather proud of myself at the same time for having done it properly.<br>
Learning to swim, learning to drown. According to Lawrence, I learned to swim comparatively late, I suppose. I was maybe nine years old, but my brother had a traumatic experience which nearly put him off for life.<br>
We lived in the U.S.A. for a while and had access to a university pool where the coaches had trained the American Olympic team. In those days, though, their idea of teaching kids how to swim was to tie a tin can to their ankles with a bit of string, throw them in the deep end, and shout, swim! I'm surprised my brother survived at all. He could only have been about six at the time.<br>
Sponsored Walk Joy said, one of my earliest physical feats was probably going on a ten-mile walk for charity when I was about seven. I went with my older brother and my dad, but they didn't make much allowance for the fact that my legs were shorter. I had to go at the same pace as them.<br>
Even so, I made it and raised quite a lot of money from school friends and teachers who had agreed to pay me for every mile I walked. Now you will have some time to review questions 21 to 25. Part 3. Questions 26 to 30.<br>
First, you will have some time to look at questions 26 to 30. Cross-Country Ordeal I remember one dark, wet afternoon in February, being herded out onto the school field and having to run three miles across country while the rain came bucketing down, my friend David told me. Soon we were all drenched to the skin, shivering with cold, and the only way to stay warm was to keep running.<br>
One of the gym teachers, who had been sitting inside having a cup of tea, came out to meet us half-way around the course, and told us to jump over a stream before we could start on the home stretch. This teacher actually stood on the hands of the boys he didn't like as they were trying to climb up the muddy bank on the other side, so that they slid back down into the freezing water. I was disgusted by this, but of course I didn't say anything.<br>
I was only twelve. I think it changed my view of human nature a bit after that, the fact that someone who I had previously respected could be so cynical and cruel. Dwarfed in Germany.<br>
William said, We went on a tour of Germany one year from secondary school to play football against three different teams there. Everyone was violently sick on the ferry going across to Holland, and the whole thing was a bit of a farce as the teacher who had arranged it didn't speak German very well, so we ended up playing teams who were three or four years older than us. Naturally, we got beaten every time.<br>
CLIMB EVERY MOUNTAIN According to Duncan, One of my best memories of early physical endeavour was climbing Ben Nevis, which is the tallest mountain in the British Isles. It was a glorious day, which is pretty rare for that part of Scotland, and we walked up in about five hours. The last bit is pretty hard going, as it's a zig-zag path of big stones.<br>
We took the family dog, and she had a really difficult time of it. The strangest thing was that we didn't see too many people on the way up, and then when we reached the top it was suddenly covered with Japanese tourists. I can only presume they had been airlifted there by helicopter.<br>
Down to earth, Philip told me. My cousins were always the outdoor adventurous types, learning how to canoe and windsurf and abseil and so on. One day, one of them climbed onto the top of the house to fix some tiles with my uncle.<br>
The next minute, he appeared at the kitchen door, a little bit dazed, and his mother, who was cooking lunch, looked at him in surprise and said, What are you doing here? I thought you were helping your dad. I've just fallen off the roof, mum, he said. Apparently he had overbalanced and toppled over backwards.<br>
Because he had recently been doing parachute training, his latest hobby, he had rolled over automatically when he hit the ground, without thinking. This was a big old two-story house, and he must have been at least ten metres from the ground. But he didn't have a scratch on him.<br>
We hope you've enjoyed this recording. First, you will have some time to look at questions 31 to 35. We hear it a lot in the news these days.<br>
Recycle newspapers and save a tree. Collect bottles and cans so they can be reused in the manufacturing of new products. Protecting our delicate environment seems to be on the agenda of politicians, government leaders, and citizens in many parts of the world to show support for Mother Nature.<br>
The concept of green consumerism has gained momentum more and more over the last decade, and the public feels moved to pitch in and help. However, three essential keys need to power this movement include a more informed public, the development of improved technology, and a greater demand for recycled materials. The first step is to raise public awareness about the recycling process, to explain the kinds of materials that can be recycled, and provide ways on how to properly dispose of them.<br>
Local governments should educate the public on how to properly sort reusable materials from those, like wax paper, carbon paper, plastic laminated materials such as fast food wrappers that can't be recycled very easily. Then a system of collecting these sorted materials needs to be established. The public interest might be there, but soon may wane if there isn't a system where they can take these materials to be recycled.<br>
Sometimes we become complacent when it comes to recycling, but when you speak in terms of actual facts and figures that everyone can understand, people become more cognizant of the problem. I remember reading one time that the energy saved from one recycled can provides enough power to operate a television for three hours. Give the public information they can grasp, and then you'll increase the chances of gaining followers.<br>
Second, technological progress has been made on many fronts, but governmental agencies need to step up their support for companies involved in recycling by providing tax incentives, low cost loans, and even grants to upgrade equipment and to encourage further research. One breakthrough has been the development of a new manufacturing process that uses enzymes to help remove ink from paper in more energy efficient and environmentally safe methods. Recycling paper materials can be expensive in both monetary and environmental terms.<br>
The difficulty in removing print from paper, the amount of energy expended during the process, and caustic waste that is sometimes produced are costs that companies incur that are then passed on to the consumer. The final key is to increase demand for the growing surplus of resources waiting to be recycled. This process has appeared in various regions of the world where the technology to process the used materials lags far behind the amount being collected for recycling.<br>
There may be a great outpouring of support, yet the great stumbling block to implementing the second stage of this plan could be impeded by the corporate sector's inability to find commercial enterprises interested in using recycled goods, especially when the cost exceeds those of virgin materials. Recycling is a crucial key to protect our planet. The three keys mentioned are important ways to achieve this end.<br>
Now you will have some time to review questions 31 to 35. That is the end of part three. That is the end of the listening comprehension test.</p>

		<p>Phần 3 Trong phần này, bạn sẽ nghe ba bài nói chuyện hoặc bài giảng. Các bài nói chuyện hoặc bài giảng sẽ chỉ được phát một lần duy nhất. Có năm câu hỏi cho mỗi bài nói chuyện hoặc bài giảng. Với mỗi câu hỏi, hãy chọn câu trả lời đúng: A, B, C hoặc D. Câu 21 đến 25 Trước tiên, bạn sẽ có một chút thời gian để xem trước các câu hỏi từ 21 đến 25. Bây giờ chúng ta đã sẵn sàng bắt đầu. Hãy lắng nghe và trả lời các câu hỏi từ 21 đến 25. Bạn sẽ chỉ được nghe đoạn ghi âm một lần duy nhất. Những ngày đi học Những ngày đi học được cho là quãng thời gian đẹp nhất trong cuộc đời, và một phần của trải nghiệm này thường liên quan đến các hoạt động thể chất đầy thử thách. Tôi đã hỏi một số đồng nghiệp về những ký ức của họ trên sân thể thao và ngoài trời, và đây là những gì họ kể lại. Chiến thắng cúp vô địch Khi tôi khoảng 10 tuổi, bạn tôi, Steve, kể rằng đội bóng của chúng tôi bất ngờ lọt vào trận chung kết cúp của giải bóng đá các trường học địa phương. Tôi nói là "bất ngờ" bởi vì tôi chỉ nhớ rằng chúng tôi đã thua gần như mọi trận đấu. Dù sao đi nữa, trong trận chung kết, tôi đã thực hiện một đường chuyền tuyệt vời cho bạn tôi, David, người đã đánh đầu ghi bàn thắng quyết định ngay trước tiếng còi mãn cuộc. Tôi vẫn còn giữ bức ảnh của đội bóng đang giơ cao chiếc cúp chiến thắng. Chuyến đi bộ xuyên rừng Thomas nói: Tôi nhớ mình đã phải dẫn đầu một nhóm gồm tám cậu bé trong một chuyến dã ngoại của trường kéo dài gần hai ngày khi tôi còn là một thiếu niên. Dù chúng tôi bị lạc tại một điểm nào đó, tôi vẫn có thể giữ tất cả mọi người đi cùng nhau và dẫn họ đi từ đầu này của khu rừng lớn đến đầu kia và quay lại, chỉ bằng sự kiên trì của bản thân. Tôi được chọn làm trưởng nhóm, có lẽ vì tôi là người duy nhất biết đọc bản đồ. Khi chúng tôi quay lại điểm cắm trại, chúng tôi phát hiện ra rằng tất cả các nhóm khác đã gian lận – họ đã đi nhờ xe hầu hết quãng đường! Tôi cảm thấy có chút "ngớ ngẩn" vì đã làm đúng luật, nhưng đồng thời cũng tự hào về bản thân vì đã hoàn thành thử thách một cách chính trực. Học bơi, suýt chết đuối Theo Lawrence, tôi học bơi khá muộn, chắc khoảng 9 tuổi, nhưng anh trai tôi đã có một trải nghiệm kinh hoàng khiến anh ấy gần như sợ nước cả đời. Chúng tôi từng sống ở Mỹ một thời gian và có cơ hội sử dụng hồ bơi của một trường đại học, nơi các huấn luyện viên đã từng đào tạo đội tuyển Olympic Mỹ. Nhưng vào thời điểm đó, cách họ dạy trẻ em bơi thực sự rất khắc nghiệt: Họ buộc một cái hộp thiếc vào mắt cá chân của bọn trẻ bằng một sợi dây, quăng chúng xuống hồ bơi sâu và hét lên: "Bơi đi!" Tôi vẫn không hiểu tại sao anh trai tôi có thể sống sót. Lúc đó anh ấy chỉ khoảng 6 tuổi thôi! Cuộc đi bộ gây quỹ từ thiện Joy nói: Một trong những thử thách thể chất đầu tiên của tôi có lẽ là tham gia một cuộc đi bộ dài 10 dặm để gây quỹ từ thiện khi tôi mới 7 tuổi. Tôi đi cùng anh trai và bố, nhưng họ không hề giảm tốc độ dù tôi nhỏ hơn họ rất nhiều. Tôi vẫn cố gắng đi suốt chặng đường, và cuối cùng đã gây quỹ được một số tiền khá lớn từ bạn bè và giáo viên – những người đã đồng ý tài trợ mỗi dặm tôi đi được. Bây giờ bạn sẽ có một chút thời gian để xem lại các câu hỏi từ 21 đến 25. Câu 26 đến 30 Trước tiên, bạn sẽ có một chút thời gian để xem trước các câu hỏi từ 26 đến 30. Những trải nghiệm thể chất khác Cuộc chạy băng đồng khắc nghiệt David kể: Tôi nhớ một buổi chiều u ám và ẩm ướt vào tháng Hai, khi chúng tôi bị buộc phải chạy ba dặm trên sân trường trong mưa xối xả. Chúng tôi ướt sũng, run lên vì lạnh, và cách duy nhất để giữ ấm là tiếp tục chạy. Một trong những giáo viên thể dục, người lúc đó đang ngồi trong nhà nhâm nhi trà, bước ra gặp chúng tôi giữa đường và bắt chúng tôi nhảy qua một con suối trước khi về đích. Vị giáo viên này thậm chí giẫm lên tay những học sinh mà ông ta không thích khi họ cố gắng leo lên bờ dốc, khiến họ trượt xuống nước lạnh. Tôi cảm thấy ghê tởm, nhưng tất nhiên, tôi không dám nói gì – lúc đó tôi chỉ mới 12 tuổi. Trải nghiệm này thay đổi cách tôi nhìn nhận con người. Tôi từng tôn trọng thầy ấy, nhưng sau chuyện đó, tôi nhận ra con người có thể tàn nhẫn và lạnh lùng đến mức nào. Thất bại ở Đức William nói: Một năm nọ, trường trung học của chúng tôi có chuyến du đấu bóng đá ở Đức. Cả đội đều bị say sóng dữ dội trên phà đi sang Hà Lan, và chuyến đi hóa thành trò hề vì giáo viên phụ trách không nói tiếng Đức giỏi. Kết quả là chúng tôi phải đấu với những đội có cầu thủ lớn hơn chúng tôi từ 3 đến 4 tuổi. Tất nhiên, chúng tôi thua tất cả các trận đấu. Chinh phục đỉnh Ben Nevis Duncan kể: Một trong những ký ức đẹp nhất của tôi về những thử thách thể chất là chinh phục đỉnh Ben Nevis, ngọn núi cao nhất của quần đảo Anh. Hôm đó thời tiết tuyệt đẹp – điều này khá hiếm ở vùng Scotland đó. Chúng tôi mất khoảng năm tiếng để leo lên. Phần khó nhất là đường ziczac toàn đá tảng gần đỉnh. Khi lên tới đỉnh, chúng tôi bất ngờ bị bao quanh bởi một nhóm khách du lịch Nhật Bản – tôi đoán họ đã được trực thăng chở lên! Cú ngã từ mái nhà Philip kể: Anh em họ tôi luôn thích những môn thể thao mạo hiểm, từ chèo thuyền kayak, lướt ván đến đu dây mạo hiểm. Một ngày nọ, một người trong số họ leo lên nóc nhà để sửa ngói cùng chú tôi. Chỉ vài phút sau, anh ấy xuất hiện trước cửa bếp, choáng váng, và mẹ anh ấy ngạc nhiên hỏi: "Sao con lại ở đây? Mẹ tưởng con đang giúp bố cơ mà?" "Con vừa rơi khỏi mái nhà, mẹ ạ." May mắn thay, anh ấy không bị thương nhờ kỹ năng lăn tự động từ khóa huấn luyện nhảy dù gần đây! Bây giờ bạn sẽ có một chút thời gian để xem lại các câu hỏi từ 26 đến 30. Phần 3 kết thúc tại đây.</p>

The difficulty in removing print from paper, the amount of energy expended during the process, and caustic waste that is sometimes produced are costs that companies incur that are then passed on to the consumer."</p>    <p>"Việc tái chế giấy có thể tốn kém cả về mặt tài chính và môi trường. Khó khăn trong việc loại bỏ mực in khỏi giấy, lượng năng lượng tiêu hao trong quá trình này, và <strong>chất thải hóa học đôi khi được tạo ra</strong> là những chi phí mà các công ty phải gánh chịu, sau đó chuyển sang cho người tiêu dùng."</p>    <p>Bài nghe xác nhận rằng việc tái chế có thể gây hại cho môi trường nếu không có biện pháp phòng ngừa đặc biệt, vì <strong>chất thải hóa học có thể được tạo ra</strong>.
