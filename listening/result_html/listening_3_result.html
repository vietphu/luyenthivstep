		<p>Part 3 In this part, you will hear three talks, or lectures. The talks or lectures will be played once only. There are five questions for each talk or lecture.<br>
For each question, choose the right answer, A, B, C, or D. Part 3 Questions 21 to 25 First, you will have some time to look at questions 21 to 25. Now we're ready to start. Listen, and answer questions 21 to 25.<br>
You will hear the recording once only. <br>
Angry Birds 2 is out, and more than 10 million people are furiously throwing feathered flyers at snorting pigs. But, while it's free to download, some players are complaining about how the game encourages in-app purchases.<br>
The makers, Rovio, says those who don't buy add-ons still get a fully formed game for free. The game allows you to gain extra lives in exchange for gems. There are several ways to gather these gems in the game, but buying them is the easiest.<br>
Eric Kayan, one reviewer, says that if you don't want to part with your money, you're forced to wait for your lives to reload. He thinks this feature will just encourage gamers to stop playing. Greedy isn't the word, but there are words to describe this sort of thing.<br>
Foolish, baffling, boneheaded. The first Angry Birds game was released in 2009, and it was a massive hit, even though players had to pay to download it. There have been other spin-offs in the series, but Angry Birds 2 has been billed as a proper follow-up.<br>
John Norris says that he played the original endlessly, and he was looking forward to the development. He thinks most people who play mobile games these days are pretty aware of how in-app purchases work. But after such an uncomplicated original game, he was really disappointed by how hard the sequel tries to make you spend your money.<br>
After these complaints were revealed, the creative director of the game, Patrick Liu, stated that they encouraged users to play, not to pay. Everybody had an equal opportunity to progress in the game, as all transactions were made with gems, for which the game allows you to gain extra lives in exchange. These gems could be earned by playing and completing challenges.<br>
Furthermore, extra birds, lives and tickets could be earned through watching videos. This fact was accessible to everyone. Angry Birds 2 could be enjoyed fully without purchasing anything, but they did offer, for purchase, a variety of ways to expand, extend and enhance the game-playing experience.<br>
But John still thinks the Finnish company has ruined Angry Birds 2. He appreciates game developers' need to make money, but the way to do that is to charge money for games people want to play, not annoy people into spending money in-game. <br>
Now you will have some time to review questions 21 to 25. First, you will have some time to look at questions 26 to 30.<br>
Now we're ready to start. Listen and answer questions 26 to 30. You will hear the recording once only.<br>
The world's first malaria vaccine has cleared one of the final hurdles prior to being approved for use in Africa. It is noticeable that malaria kills around 584,000 people a year worldwide. Most of them children under five in sub-Saharan Africa.<br>
The European Medicines Agency gave a positive scientific opinion after assessing its safety and effectiveness. It represents a green light for the Mosquerix injection developed by GlaxoSmithKline, G-S-K for short. Mosquerix is the first against a parasitic infection in humans.<br>
Scientists who have been working on this vaccine for 30 years said that this was a hugely significant moment and this was a dream come true. It has been designed specifically to combat malaria infection in children in Africa and will not be licensed for travelers. Earlier this year, final results of a clinical trial in seven African countries yielded mixed results.<br>
The best protection was among children aged five to 17 months who received three doses of the vaccine a month apart plus a booster dose at 20 months. In this group, cases of severe malaria were cut by a third over four years. But the effectiveness of the vaccine declined over time making the booster shot essential.<br>
Without a booster, the vaccine did not cut the rate of severe malaria over the trial period. And disappointingly, the injection did not prove very effective in protecting young babies from severe malaria. Furthermore, it has been hoped the injection could be administered at 6, 10 and 14 weeks along with other childhood vaccines.<br>
But the results suggest the injections need to be started later which would involve a huge amount of organization and extra cost as it is outside the childhood vaccine schedule. Besides, the trial results show it is crucial that children receive all four doses of the injection in order to benefit. But even in partially effective malaria vaccine could have a role to play in countries with very high rates of disease.<br>
GSK began research on a malaria vaccine 30 years ago and the first trials in Africa began in 1998. In 2001, a partnership was established between GSK and the PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative through a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The project aimed to speed up malaria vaccine development.<br>
In 2009, 11 centres began recruiting 16,000 children in 7 sub-Saharan African countries. Today marks a significant scientific milestone for the long-standing partnership to develop a vaccine. Yet several more steps remain before a malaria vaccine might reach the young children in Africa who most need protection against this deadly human parasite.<br>
Now you will have some time to review questions 26 to 30. Part 3. Questions 31 to 35 First, you will have some time to look at questions 31 to 35. Now we're ready to start.<br>
Listen and answer questions 31 to 35. You will hear the recording once only. <br>
Scientists may be one step closer to uncovering the origins of cheese making as evidence that is thousands of years old has been uncovered.<br>
Truly an ancient art, no one really knows exactly when humans began making cheese. But now milk extracts have been identified on 34 perforated pottery vessels or cheese strainers that are 7,500 years old and have been excavated in Poland. Ms. Salk and other scientists believe that this is obvious evidence of cheese making in northern Europe during Neolithic times and their findings have been published in the scientific journal Nature.<br>
Ms. Salk and her team also analyzed lipid remains on the vessels and detected milk remains which they say provides a link to cheese making. Although scientists have not identified traces of cheese, they have put together a convincing case. Is it possible that prehistoric people were making cheese much earlier than 7,500 years ago? Ms. Salk explains that the most important ingredient for cheese making is milk and only domesticated animals can be milked.<br>
Thus, it is unlikely that the origins of cheese making predates the Neolithic time period. Earlier examples of milk remains have been detected on pottery vessels from the Near East dating back 8,000 years, although the evidence does not suggest that they were used for milk processing activities. The only other written evidence for cheese making activity occurred much later in the archaeological record, around 5,000 years ago.<br>
What would have prompted Neolithic people to start making cheese? Scientists revealed that genetic and computer simulations have shown that at that time people were largely lactose intolerant. Processing milk into cheese allows the lactose content of milk to be reduced. Thus, making cheese allowed them to consume dairy products without the undesirable health effects.<br>
So, what might a prehistoric cheese have tasted like? I guess it would have been like the traditional cheese you can get now. Ms. Salk said that in France we have the picoron, traditionally made in farms with cow or goat milk. I would imagine that prehistoric cheese would have been like this.<br>
It's likely to have been a softer cheese. Andrew Dalby says that the taste of the cheese may have changed according to the season. Similar to those cheeses made in the region of France where I live.<br>
The result can be quite different depending on the season. Sometimes cheeses harden and do in fact keep and still taste great months later. Now you will have some time to review questions 31 to 35.<br>
That is the end of Part 3. That is the end of the Listening Comprehension Test.</p>

		<p>Phần 3 Trong phần này, bạn sẽ nghe ba bài nói hoặc bài giảng. Các bài nói hoặc bài giảng sẽ chỉ được phát một lần duy nhất. Mỗi bài nói hoặc bài giảng có năm câu hỏi đi kèm. Với mỗi câu hỏi, hãy chọn đáp án đúng A, B, C hoặc D. Phần 3, câu hỏi 21-25 Trước tiên, bạn sẽ có một chút thời gian để xem các câu hỏi từ 21 đến 25. Bây giờ, chúng ta sẵn sàng bắt đầu. Hãy lắng nghe và trả lời các câu hỏi từ 21 đến 25. Bạn sẽ chỉ nghe đoạn ghi âm một lần duy nhất. Angry Birds 2 đã ra mắt, và hơn 10 triệu người đang hào hứng ném những chú chim giận dữ vào những con lợn hồng. Nhưng mặc dù có thể tải về miễn phí, một số người chơi phàn nàn rằng trò chơi khuyến khích mua hàng trong ứng dụng. Nhà sản xuất, Rovio, cho biết những ai không mua vật phẩm bổ sung vẫn có thể chơi một trò chơi hoàn chỉnh miễn phí. Trò chơi cho phép bạn nhận thêm mạng bằng cách đổi lấy đá quý. Có nhiều cách để thu thập đá quý trong trò chơi, nhưng cách dễ nhất là mua chúng. Eric Kayan, một nhà phê bình, cho rằng nếu không muốn bỏ tiền, bạn sẽ phải chờ mạng hồi phục. Anh ấy nghĩ rằng tính năng này sẽ chỉ khiến người chơi bỏ cuộc. "Tham lam" có lẽ chưa phải là từ đúng, nhưng có những từ khác để mô tả điều này: ngu ngốc, khó hiểu, thiếu suy nghĩ. Trò chơi Angry Birds đầu tiên được phát hành vào năm 2009, và đó là một cú hit lớn, dù người chơi phải trả tiền để tải về. Đã có nhiều phần phụ trong loạt trò chơi này, nhưng Angry Birds 2 được quảng bá như một phần tiếp theo thực sự. John Norris nói rằng anh ấy đã chơi phần gốc không ngừng nghỉ và rất mong chờ sự phát triển của trò chơi. Anh ấy nghĩ rằng hầu hết người chơi di động ngày nay đều hiểu rõ cách hoạt động của các giao dịch trong ứng dụng. Nhưng sau một trò chơi gốc đơn giản, anh ấy thực sự thất vọng về cách phần tiếp theo cố gắng khiến bạn phải chi tiền. Sau khi những lời phàn nàn này được đưa ra, giám đốc sáng tạo của trò chơi, Patrick Liu, tuyên bố rằng họ khuyến khích người chơi chơi game, chứ không phải trả tiền. Tất cả người chơi đều có cơ hội tiến bộ như nhau, vì mọi giao dịch đều được thực hiện bằng đá quý, thứ có thể kiếm được bằng cách chơi và hoàn thành thử thách. Hơn nữa, người chơi có thể kiếm thêm chim, mạng và vé bằng cách xem video. Điều này có sẵn cho tất cả mọi người. Angry Birds 2 có thể được tận hưởng hoàn toàn mà không cần mua gì cả, nhưng họ cũng cung cấp nhiều cách khác nhau để mở rộng, kéo dài và nâng cao trải nghiệm chơi game. Nhưng John vẫn nghĩ rằng công ty Phần Lan này đã phá hỏng Angry Birds 2. Anh ấy hiểu rằng các nhà phát triển game cần kiếm tiền, nhưng cách tốt nhất để làm điều đó là tính phí cho những trò chơi mà mọi người muốn chơi, chứ không phải khiến họ khó chịu để buộc họ chi tiền trong trò chơi. Bây giờ bạn sẽ có một chút thời gian để xem lại các câu hỏi từ 21 đến 25. Trước tiên, bạn sẽ có một chút thời gian để xem các câu hỏi từ 26 đến 30. Bây giờ, chúng ta sẵn sàng bắt đầu. Hãy lắng nghe và trả lời các câu hỏi từ 26 đến 30. Bạn sẽ chỉ nghe đoạn ghi âm một lần duy nhất. Vắc-xin sốt rét đầu tiên trên thế giới đã vượt qua một trong những rào cản cuối cùng trước khi được phê duyệt sử dụng tại châu Phi. Lưu ý rằng bệnh sốt rét giết chết khoảng 584.000 người mỗi năm trên toàn cầu, hầu hết là trẻ em dưới năm tuổi ở khu vực cận Sahara châu Phi. Cơ quan Dược phẩm châu Âu đã đưa ra đánh giá khoa học tích cực sau khi đánh giá độ an toàn và hiệu quả của vắc-xin này. Đây là tín hiệu xanh cho loại vắc-xin Mosquirix, do GlaxoSmithKline (viết tắt là GSK) phát triển. Mosquirix là loại vắc-xin đầu tiên chống lại bệnh nhiễm ký sinh trùng ở người. Các nhà khoa học đã nghiên cứu vắc-xin này trong 30 năm cho rằng đây là một cột mốc quan trọng và là giấc mơ trở thành hiện thực. Nó được thiết kế đặc biệt để chống lại bệnh sốt rét ở trẻ em châu Phi và sẽ không được cấp phép cho khách du lịch. Kết quả thử nghiệm lâm sàng cuối cùng tại bảy quốc gia châu Phi vào đầu năm nay cho thấy kết quả không đồng nhất. Mức bảo vệ tốt nhất là ở trẻ từ 5 đến 17 tháng tuổi, những trẻ nhận ba liều vắc-xin cách nhau một tháng, kèm theo một liều tăng cường ở tháng thứ 20. Trong nhóm này, số ca mắc sốt rét nặng giảm một phần ba trong vòng bốn năm. Nhưng hiệu quả của vắc-xin giảm theo thời gian, khiến liều tăng cường trở nên cần thiết. Không có liều tăng cường, vắc-xin không giúp giảm tỷ lệ mắc sốt rét nặng trong suốt thời gian thử nghiệm. Và đáng thất vọng là vắc-xin không mang lại hiệu quả cao trong việc bảo vệ trẻ sơ sinh khỏi sốt rét nặng. Bây giờ bạn sẽ có một chút thời gian để xem lại các câu hỏi từ 26 đến 30. Phần 3, câu hỏi 31-35 Trước tiên, bạn sẽ có một chút thời gian để xem các câu hỏi từ 31 đến 35. Bây giờ, chúng ta sẵn sàng bắt đầu. Hãy lắng nghe và trả lời các câu hỏi từ 31 đến 35. Bạn sẽ chỉ nghe đoạn ghi âm một lần duy nhất. Các nhà khoa học có thể đã tiến gần hơn một bước đến việc khám phá nguồn gốc của quá trình làm pho mát, khi những bằng chứng có niên đại hàng nghìn năm được phát hiện. Làm pho mát thực sự là một nghệ thuật cổ xưa, không ai thực sự biết chính xác khi nào con người bắt đầu làm pho mát. Nhưng hiện nay, các chiết xuất từ sữa đã được xác định trên 34 mảnh gốm đục lỗ, hoặc dụng cụ lọc pho mát, có niên đại 7.500 năm và được khai quật ở Ba Lan. Bà Salk và các nhà khoa học khác tin rằng đây là bằng chứng rõ ràng về quá trình làm pho mát ở Bắc Âu trong thời kỳ đồ đá mới, và phát hiện này đã được công bố trên tạp chí khoa học Nature. Bây giờ bạn sẽ có một chút thời gian để xem lại các câu hỏi từ 31 đến 35. Đây là phần kết thúc của phần 3. Đây là phần kết thúc của bài kiểm tra nghe hiểu.</p>

								<strong>Giải thích:</strong> <p><strong>Đáp án:</strong></p> <p><span class="text-success"><strong>Milk with lactose upset their digestion.</strong></span></p>  <p><strong>Giải thích chi tiết:</strong></p> <p>Trong bài nghe, thông tin về tình trạng không dung nạp lactose của người thời kỳ đồ đá mới được đề cập:</p> <p>"Scientists revealed that genetic and computer simulations have shown that at that time people were largely lactose intolerant. Processing milk into cheese allows the lactose content of milk to be reduced. Thus, making cheese allowed them to consume dairy products without the undesirable health effects."</p> <p>"Các nhà khoa học tiết lộ rằng mô phỏng di truyền và máy tính đã cho thấy vào thời điểm đó, con người phần lớn không dung nạp lactose. Việc chế biến sữa thành pho mát giúp giảm hàm lượng lactose trong sữa. Vì vậy, làm pho mát đã giúp họ tiêu thụ các sản phẩm từ sữa mà không gặp phải tác động sức khỏe không mong muốn."</p>  <p>Điều này có nghĩa là <strong>sữa có chứa lactose gây ra vấn đề tiêu hóa cho người thời kỳ đồ đá mới</strong>. Do đó, đáp án chính xác là <strong>Milk with lactose upset their digestion.</strong></p>  <p><strong>Phân tích các lựa chọn:</strong></p> <ul>     <li><span class="text-danger">They didn’t like milk with lactose in it.</span> ❌ (Họ không thích sữa có chứa lactose.) - Sai, vì bài nghe nói rằng họ không thể tiêu hóa lactose, không phải vì họ không thích sữa.</li>     <li><span class="text-success"><strong>Milk with lactose upset their digestion.</strong></span> ✅ (Sữa có chứa lactose làm rối loạn tiêu hóa của họ.) - Đúng, vì bài nghe nói rằng họ không dung nạp lactose và phải chế biến sữa thành pho mát để tiêu thụ.</li>     <li><span class="text-danger">It was the reason for their cheese invention.</span> ❌ (Đây là lý do khiến họ phát minh ra pho mát.) - Sai, vì bài nghe không khẳng định rằng đây là lý do chính dẫn đến việc làm pho mát.</li>     <li><span class="text-danger">It prevented them from consuming dairy food.</span> ❌ (Nó ngăn họ tiêu thụ thực phẩm từ sữa.) - Sai, vì họ vẫn có thể tiêu thụ các sản phẩm từ sữa bằng cách làm pho mát để giảm lactose.</li> </ul>							</div>

								<strong>Giải thích:</strong> <p><strong>Đáp án:</strong></p> <p><span class="text-success"><strong>There is a time to make the best cheese.</strong></span></p>  <p><strong>Giải thích chi tiết:</strong></p> <p>Trong bài nghe, có một phần đề cập đến thời điểm làm pho mát tốt nhất:</p> <p>"Andrew Dalby says that the taste of the cheese may have changed according to the season. Similar to those cheeses made in the region of France where I live. The result can be quite different depending on the season."</p> <p>"Andrew Dalby nói rằng hương vị của pho mát có thể thay đổi theo mùa. Tương tự như những loại pho mát được làm ở khu vực nước Pháp nơi tôi sống. Kết quả có thể khác biệt đáng kể tùy vào mùa."</p>  <p>Điều này cho thấy rằng <strong>thời điểm trong năm có thể ảnh hưởng đến chất lượng pho mát</strong>.
