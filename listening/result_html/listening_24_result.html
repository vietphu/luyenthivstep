		<p>Part 3 In this part, you will hear three talks, or lectures. The talks or lectures will be played once only. There are five questions for each talk or lecture.<br>
For each question, choose the right answer, A, B, C, or D. Part 3 Questions 21 to 25 First, you will have some time to look at questions 21 to 25. Now we're ready to start. Listen, and answer questions 21 to 25.<br>
You will hear the recording once only. I want to talk about learning languages. I've lived in many different countries, both in Western Europe, the Middle East, and now here in Hong Kong.<br>
And during all of that time, I've learned five or six different languages, to one degree or another. I love learning languages. Not only are they important when you move to a country, I just find them fascinating.<br>
Before I came to Hong Kong, I lived in Barcelona, Spain for ten years. And when I first arrived, the most important thing was being able to communicate with people locally. I don't attend classes.<br>
I don't think I'm particularly good in classes. I prefer to learn by just talking to people, finding out what I need to say, by looking at dictionaries, and listening carefully. Other things that helped me when I first moved to Spain were watching the typical kinds of programs we see every day on channels around the world.<br>
For example, the weather. This is great because they always say the same things, so you can really quickly hear the same words repeated again and again, and the pictures help of course. Other types of program that helped me learn Spanish quickly were things like game shows, where the same thing happens.<br>
They have a catchphrase or a slogan that they repeat endlessly when contestants win or when they're called to compete. As well as that, I used to pick up the Spanish newspapers. First of all, I just accepted there was no way I was going to understand anything but one or two words.<br>
But gradually, I found that I learned lots of new things about this. I was interested because I wanted to know what was happening in the country I lived in. But I also knew that I could learn a lot of language this way, so I'd take a dictionary with me sometimes, or I'd notice a word and I'd ask other people what it meant.<br>
Anyway, by far the best practice I ever had was just talking to people in the street or in shops, where I'd rehearse in my head what I wanted to say beforehand before I went in. Usually I made a right mess of it first of all, but after you get over the embarrassment, it's quite funny really, and people are very sympathetic and supporting in most cases. It took me a long time to develop a good level of Spanish.<br>
I lived there for ten years, and I think I'm very fluent now, but I think for the first two years that I was there, it was quite a struggle to hold a decent conversation. There were always lots of words and expressions that I didn't pick up on. In particular were the colloquial expressions, idioms, that kind of thing, that people use in everyday talk, but you don't necessarily see written down.<br>
I didn't find those very easy to learn at all. But it was a lot of fun, and people, as I said, are really supporting when they know that you're genuinely interested in learning their language. Now you will have some time to review questions 21 to 25.<br>
Part three, questions 26 to 30. First, you will have some time to look at questions 26 to 30. Hello ladies and gentlemen.<br>
It gives me great pleasure to introduce our keynote speaker for today's plenary address, Dr. Howard Miller. Dr. Miller, Professor of Sociology at Washington University, has written numerous articles and books on the issues facing older Americans in our grand society for the past 15 years. Dr. Miller? Thank you for that introduction.<br>
Today I'd like to preface my remarks from a story from my own life, which I feel highlights our common concerns that bring us here together. Several years ago, when my grandparents were well into their 80s, they were faced with the reality of no longer being able to adequately care for themselves. My grandfather spoke of his greatest fear, that of leaving the only home they had known for the past 60 years.<br>
Fighting back the tears, he spoke proudly of the fact that he had built their home from the ground up, and that he had pounded every nail and laid every brick in the process. The prospect of having to sell their home and give up their independence and move into a retirement home was an extremely traumatic experience for them. It was, in my grandfather's own words, like having a limb severed off.<br>
He was quite emphatic, exclaiming that he felt he wasn't important anymore. For them and some older Americans, their so-called golden years are at times not so pleasant, for this period can mean the decline of not only one's health, but the loss of identity and self-worth. In many societies, this self-identity is closely related with our social status, occupation, material possessions, or independence.<br>
Furthermore, we often live in societies that value that which is new or in vogue, and our own usage of lexicon in the English language often does not bode well for older Americans. I mean, how would your family react if you came home tonight, elated, exclaiming, hey, come to the living room and see the old black and white TV I brought? Unfortunately, the word old conjures up images of the need to replace or discard. Now, many of the lectures given at this conference have focused on the issues of pension reform, medical care, and the development of public facilities for senior citizens.<br>
And while these are vital issues that must be addressed, I'd like to focus my comments on an underlying issue that will affect the overall success of the other programs mentioned. This has to do with realigning our perspectives on what it means to be part of this group and finding meaningful roles the elderly can play and should play in our societies. First of all, I'd like to talk about... Bạn đang thi tại website luyệnthivistep.vn Now you will have some time to review questions 26 to 30.<br>
Part 3. Questions 31 to 35. First, you will have some time to look at questions 31 to 35. Good morning.<br>
Today I'm going to talk about how to study. Now, you probably think you know all about that, right? You've been studying for years and I expect some of you are fantastic at studying, really organised and good at concentrating, but there's always room for improvement and your exams aren't far away. So these tips are for all of you.<br>
Right, so what's the best way to study? Well, first of all, it's a good idea to have some kind of plan or timetable. This could be for the week or a longer revision timetable for an exam from one month to six months. Yes, if you're studying for an important exam, it's important to think long term.<br>
Draw up a timetable, but revise it often. If it's not going to plan, you may have to rethink it. Next, think about your environment.<br>
Make sure the place where you're going to study is comfortable with enough light, air, etc. Not too hot, not too cold. Make sure there are no distracting noises around, such as television.<br>
If you think you concentrate better listening to music, experiment and see if it's really true. Some people really do seem to work better with music in the background, especially classical music, but for many people it spoils their concentration. However, if you have to work near a TV, you might have to use headphones to play music to drown out the sound of the TV.<br>
In this case, find out what kind of music works best for you. Maybe something without words. By the way, you might think you work fine with a TV on, but again, experiment.<br>
You might be surprised at how much better you work away from a TV. Oh, and the other thing is the Internet. Text messages, Twitter, Facebook, etc.<br>
Forget about all of that while you're studying. No, really, you can ignore it for an hour or so. It won't be the end of the world if you don't reply to a message immediately.<br>
Now you will have some time to review questions 31 to 35. That is the end of Part 3. That is the end of the Listening Comprehension Test.</p>

		<p>Phần 3 Trong phần này, bạn sẽ nghe ba bài nói hoặc bài giảng. Mỗi bài nói hoặc bài giảng sẽ chỉ được phát một lần. Mỗi bài có năm câu hỏi. Đối với mỗi câu hỏi, hãy chọn đáp án đúng A, B, C hoặc D. Câu 21 đến 25 Trước tiên, bạn sẽ có một chút thời gian để đọc câu hỏi 21 đến 25. Bây giờ chúng ta đã sẵn sàng để bắt đầu. Hãy lắng nghe và trả lời các câu hỏi 21 đến 25. Tôi muốn nói về việc học ngôn ngữ. Tôi đã sống ở nhiều quốc gia khác nhau, từ Tây Âu, Trung Đông, và bây giờ là Hồng Kông. Trong suốt thời gian đó, tôi đã học năm hoặc sáu ngôn ngữ ở nhiều mức độ khác nhau. Tôi rất thích học ngôn ngữ. Không chỉ vì chúng quan trọng khi bạn chuyển đến một quốc gia mới, mà tôi còn thấy chúng rất thú vị. Trước khi đến Hồng Kông, tôi đã sống ở Barcelona, Tây Ban Nha trong mười năm. Khi tôi mới đến, điều quan trọng nhất là có thể giao tiếp với người dân địa phương. Tôi không tham gia lớp học vì tôi nghĩ mình không giỏi khi học trong lớp. Tôi thích học bằng cách nói chuyện trực tiếp, tra từ điển, và chú ý lắng nghe. Những điều khác giúp tôi học tiếng Tây Ban Nha nhanh hơn là xem các chương trình truyền hình phổ biến, như dự báo thời tiết. Đây là một phương pháp tuyệt vời, vì họ luôn nói những câu giống nhau, giúp tôi nhanh chóng học được từ vựng. Ngoài ra, tôi cũng thích xem chương trình trò chơi, nơi có các khẩu hiệu được lặp đi lặp lại khi người chơi thắng hoặc được gọi tên. Tôi cũng đọc báo Tây Ban Nha. Ban đầu, tôi không hiểu gì, nhưng dần dần, tôi học được nhiều từ mới. Tôi cũng mang theo từ điển, hoặc hỏi những người xung quanh khi gặp một từ lạ. Nhưng phương pháp hiệu quả nhất đối với tôi là giao tiếp với mọi người ngoài đường hoặc trong các cửa hàng. Tôi luôn luyện tập trước trong đầu những gì mình sẽ nói, nhưng khi nói ra, tôi thường mắc lỗi. Tuy nhiên, sau khi vượt qua sự xấu hổ, tôi thấy điều đó khá vui, và người dân thường rất thông cảm, giúp đỡ tôi. Mất hai năm để tôi có thể nói chuyện trôi chảy bằng tiếng Tây Ban Nha. Nhưng những biểu cảm thông dụng, thành ngữ, hay tiếng lóng rất khó để học, vì chúng không thường xuất hiện trong sách vở. Nhìn chung, đó là một trải nghiệm thú vị, và người dân luôn hỗ trợ nếu họ thấy bạn thực sự muốn học ngôn ngữ của họ. Bây giờ bạn sẽ có một chút thời gian để kiểm tra lại các câu hỏi 21 đến 25. Câu 26 đến 30 Trước tiên, bạn sẽ có một chút thời gian để đọc câu hỏi 26 đến 30. Bây giờ chúng ta đã sẵn sàng để bắt đầu. Hãy lắng nghe và trả lời các câu hỏi 26 đến 30. Xin chào quý vị và các bạn. Tôi xin giới thiệu diễn giả chính của hội nghị hôm nay - Tiến sĩ Howard Miller. Ông là Giáo sư Xã hội học tại Đại học Washington, và đã viết nhiều bài báo và cuốn sách về những vấn đề mà người cao tuổi Mỹ đang phải đối mặt trong 15 năm qua. Tiến sĩ Miller, xin mời ông. Cảm ơn phần giới thiệu. Hôm nay, tôi muốn bắt đầu bằng một câu chuyện cá nhân, câu chuyện mà tôi nghĩ sẽ làm nổi bật những mối quan tâm chung của chúng ta. Cách đây vài năm, khi ông bà tôi đã ngoài 80 tuổi, họ phải đối mặt với thực tế rằng họ không thể tự chăm sóc bản thân nữa. Ông tôi rất sợ hãi khi phải rời xa ngôi nhà mà họ đã sống trong suốt 60 năm. Ông rất tự hào vì đã tự tay xây dựng từng viên gạch, từng cây đinh trong ngôi nhà đó. Khi phải bán nhà và chuyển đến viện dưỡng lão, ông nói đó giống như bị mất đi một phần cơ thể. Ông cảm thấy rằng mình không còn quan trọng nữa. Với nhiều người cao tuổi, "những năm tháng vàng" không phải lúc nào cũng đẹp đẽ, mà đó là sự suy giảm sức khỏe, danh tính và giá trị bản thân. Trong xã hội ngày nay, giá trị bản thân thường gắn liền với nghề nghiệp, tài sản và sự tự lập. Tuy nhiên, chúng ta lại đánh giá cao những thứ mới mẻ, và từ "cũ" thường mang nghĩa cần được thay thế. Ví dụ, nếu hôm nay bạn về nhà và nói "Hãy xem chiếc TV đen trắng cũ mà tôi mới mua!", chắc chắn gia đình bạn sẽ rất ngạc nhiên. Từ "cũ" thường gợi lên hình ảnh của sự lỗi thời và bị bỏ đi. Vì vậy, trong khi nhiều hội thảo tập trung vào lương hưu, chăm sóc y tế và cơ sở vật chất cho người già, tôi muốn nhấn mạnh một vấn đề quan trọng hơn: Chúng ta cần thay đổi cách nhìn nhận về người cao tuổi và tìm ra vai trò phù hợp cho họ trong xã hội. Bây giờ bạn sẽ có một chút thời gian để kiểm tra lại các câu hỏi 26 đến 30. Câu 31 đến 35 Trước tiên, bạn sẽ có một chút thời gian để đọc câu hỏi 31 đến 35. Bây giờ chúng ta đã sẵn sàng để bắt đầu. Hãy lắng nghe và trả lời các câu hỏi 31 đến 35. Chào buổi sáng. Hôm nay, tôi sẽ nói về cách học tập hiệu quả. Có thể bạn nghĩ rằng mình đã biết hết, nhưng vẫn có nhiều cách để cải thiện. Kỳ thi của các bạn đang đến gần, vì vậy những mẹo này sẽ giúp ích cho tất cả mọi người. Đầu tiên, hãy lập kế hoạch học tập. Điều này có thể là kế hoạch hàng tuần, hoặc lịch ôn thi dài hạn từ một đến sáu tháng. Thứ hai, tạo một môi trường học tập tốt. Tránh tiếng ồn, đảm bảo ánh sáng đủ, và không quá nóng hoặc quá lạnh. Một số người thích nghe nhạc khi học, nhưng hãy thử nghiệm xem điều đó có thực sự giúp ích không. Và quan trọng nhất, tắt điện thoại và đừng để bị phân tâm bởi tin nhắn hay mạng xã hội. Bây giờ bạn sẽ có một chút thời gian để kiểm tra lại các câu hỏi 31 đến 35. Đây là phần kết thúc của Phần 3. Đây cũng là phần kết thúc của bài kiểm tra kỹ năng nghe hiểu.</p>
