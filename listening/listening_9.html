			<p>Part 3. In this part, you will hear three talks or lectures. The talks or lectures will be played once only. There are five questions for each talk or lecture.<br>
For each question, choose the right answer, A, B, C, or D. Part 3. Questions 21 to 25. First, you will have some time to look at questions 21 to 25. Now we're ready to start.<br>
Listen and answer questions 21 to 25. You will hear the recording once only. <br>
I was a small child when I left Vietnam and moved with my family to live in America.<br>
For me and my little brother, it didn't take long before we felt American. But for my parents and two older sisters, it was a different story. The biggest problem for my mother was the language.<br>
We were living in New York, and although there were quite a lot of Vietnamese families near us, they didn't work in the stores. This meant my mother had to take me with her when she went shopping, and I was usually at school. For my father, the most important thing when we arrived was to find a job.<br>
Luckily, he had friends who knew us in Vietnam, and they helped him get a job in a factory. It was hard for him to do that sort of work. In Saigon, he had been a doctor.<br>
My two older sisters went to high school. They worked hard and did well, and the school gave them extra English lessons. Even now, though, they speak with Vietnamese accents.<br>
My brother and I are lucky. We may look Vietnamese, but we speak with American accents. My family found the way of life very different.<br>
In Vietnam, my mother used to spend a lot of time visiting her sisters and brothers and looking after her mother and father. She feels quite lonely now. She says that in America, you live inside your house, but in Vietnam, you take your house outside onto the street and share your life with everybody.<br>
I don't remember that, but I do find the winters are quite hard to put up with in New York. It's very cold and snows a lot. My mother still wears traditional Vietnamese clothes at home and always cooks us rice and noodles.<br>
I must admit, I prefer burgers and chips. Although my friends like to visit us, I often feel a bit embarrassed by my parents' way of life. They don't understand Americans, and I think I am more American than Vietnamese now.<br>
I suppose it's sad for them to have such a strange daughter. Now you will have some time to review questions 21 to 25. Part 3. Questions 26 to 30.<br>
First, you will have some time to look at questions 26 to 30.<br>
In American schools, almost every classroom is a mix of boys and girls. However, it was not always this way.<br>
In the past, schools did not teach girls subjects like science and math. In 1972, a law called Title IX was made in America. It gave girls an equal chance at education.<br>
Since then, boys and girls have been taught together. Recently, though, some schools are reconsidering separating classes. This is different than in the past, however.<br>
Girls still learn the same subjects as boys. They just study without boys in the classroom. Why? Well, scientists know that boys and girls learn differently.<br>
They also behave differently in the classroom. Boys are louder and more confident. They like to talk and show what they know.<br>
In general, girls are quieter. They prefer to listen and think carefully before they give their answers. When boys and girls are together, the boys can be too dominant.<br>
Also, boys and girls can bother each other. Instead of thinking about the lesson, they think about each other. In a separated classroom, they behave better and can focus on studying.<br>
Another reason for separated classes is that boys and girls often like different things. For instance, boys prefer stories with action and adventure. In an all-boys English class, the teacher can choose books that will be interesting to boys.<br>
This way, they will be more excited about the stories. Not all the classes are separated, just the main subjects, like English, math, science, and social studies. Still, some teachers think that separate education is not good.<br>
They worry that boys and girls will not learn how to work well together. Right now, less than 600 schools are trying separate classrooms. Time will show if it is a good idea or something that should be left in the past.<br>
Now you will have some time to review questions 26 to 30. Part 3. Questions 31 to 35 First, you will have some time to look at questions 31 to 35. Hi, I'd like to welcome all of you to the International Student Orientation at Norwalk College.<br>
I hope that your travels from your home country have been easy and that you are all settling in well. I believe I've met everyone, but just in case, I'm the Director for International Student Affairs. The person you can come to if you're having problems with your classes, your housing, visas.<br>
You're always welcome to stop by my office. We'll have several short workshops today, and we'll be talking about some common issues that international students face. The first one that I want to deal with is about communication.<br>
And in particular, nonverbal communication. Now, all of you have been studying English for some time. You have a good vocabulary, and you probably know all about verb tenses and modals and can ask directions and order from a menu.<br>
But communication is not only verbal. That is, talking is not the only language we use to communicate. Another way we communicate is through nonverbal communication, or body language.<br>
The term body language means the movements we use and the facial expressions we have, like smiling or frowning. The way we sit or stand. The way we touch or look at someone.<br>
The distance we stand from another person. Some psychologists say that more than 60% of our communication is actually done through body language. We do it without thinking or without ever having been specifically taught what the gestures or expressions mean.<br>
The problem is that body language is a little bit different in each culture, and this can often cause some problems with communication. Here's an example. In many places, it may be a little rude or disrespectful to look at another person directly in their eyes as you talk with them.<br>
So many international students will avoid this eye contact. But in America, we expect it. We think of eye contact as a sign of honesty and straightforwardness.<br>
American parents actually encourage their children to look people in the eye when speaking. Just imagine a conversation where an international student was trying to be respectful by not looking into the eyes of her American classmate. The American might wonder why her classmate wouldn't look directly at her, and the international classmate would be wondering why she was being stared at.<br>
The end result is an awkward and frustrating interaction. Here's another one. Americans shake hands firmly when they greet each other, because to Americans, a firm handshake signifies strength and power.<br>
But a soft or limp handshake is considered a sign of weakness. In some cultures, handshakes are less common, or a gentle, soft handshake is acceptable. So students need to know that when shaking hands, it's important to be firm.<br>
In America, a thumbs-up sign and a thumbs-down sign are common. <br>
Now you will have some time to review questions 31 to 35. That is the end of Part 3. That is the end of the Listening Comprehension Test.</p>

			<p>Phần 3 Trong phần này, bạn sẽ nghe ba bài nói hoặc bài giảng. Các bài nói hoặc bài giảng sẽ chỉ được phát một lần duy nhất. Mỗi bài nói hoặc bài giảng có năm câu hỏi đi kèm. Với mỗi câu hỏi, hãy chọn đáp án đúng A, B, C hoặc D. Phần 3, câu hỏi 21-25 Trước tiên, bạn sẽ có một chút thời gian để xem các câu hỏi từ 21 đến 25. Bây giờ, chúng ta sẵn sàng bắt đầu. Hãy lắng nghe và trả lời các câu hỏi từ 21 đến 25. Bạn sẽ chỉ nghe đoạn ghi âm một lần duy nhất. Mình còn nhỏ khi rời Việt Nam và chuyển đến Mỹ cùng gia đình. Với mình và em trai, không mất nhiều thời gian để cảm thấy như người Mỹ. Nhưng với bố mẹ và hai chị gái, đó là một câu chuyện khác. Vấn đề lớn nhất của mẹ mình là ngôn ngữ. Chúng mình sống ở New York, và dù có khá nhiều gia đình người Việt gần đó, họ không làm việc trong các cửa hàng. Điều đó có nghĩa là mẹ mình phải đưa mình đi cùng khi đi mua sắm, nhưng thường thì mình ở trường. Với bố mình, điều quan trọng nhất khi đến Mỹ là tìm việc làm. May mắn thay, ông có những người bạn đã quen biết từ Việt Nam, và họ đã giúp ông có một công việc trong nhà máy. Đó là một công việc vất vả đối với ông. Ở Sài Gòn, ông từng là bác sĩ. Hai chị gái mình học trung học. Họ học rất chăm chỉ và đạt kết quả tốt, nhà trường còn cho họ học thêm tiếng Anh. Nhưng ngay cả bây giờ, họ vẫn nói tiếng Anh với giọng Việt. Mình và em trai thì may mắn hơn. Dù trông vẫn giống người Việt, nhưng bọn mình nói tiếng Anh với giọng Mỹ. Gia đình mình thấy lối sống ở Mỹ rất khác biệt. Ở Việt Nam, mẹ mình dành nhiều thời gian đến thăm anh chị em và chăm sóc ông bà. Bây giờ bà cảm thấy khá cô đơn. Mẹ nói rằng ở Mỹ, người ta sống trong nhà của họ, nhưng ở Việt Nam, họ đưa cuộc sống ra ngoài đường và chia sẻ với mọi người. Mình không nhớ nhiều về điều đó, nhưng mùa đông ở New York thực sự rất khó chịu. Trời rất lạnh và có nhiều tuyết. Mẹ mình vẫn mặc quần áo truyền thống Việt Nam ở nhà và luôn nấu cơm và phở. Mình phải thừa nhận rằng mình thích bánh burger và khoai tây chiên hơn. Mặc dù bạn bè thích đến nhà mình, nhưng đôi khi mình cảm thấy hơi xấu hổ về cách sống của bố mẹ. Họ không hiểu người Mỹ, và mình nghĩ rằng mình đã trở nên Mỹ hơn là Việt Nam. Chắc hẳn điều đó khiến họ buồn vì có một cô con gái xa lạ như vậy. Bây giờ bạn sẽ có một chút thời gian để xem lại các câu hỏi từ 21 đến 25. Phần 3, câu hỏi 26-30 Trước tiên, bạn sẽ có một chút thời gian để xem các câu hỏi từ 26 đến 30. Trong các trường học ở Mỹ, hầu hết mọi lớp học đều có cả nam và nữ. Tuy nhiên, không phải lúc nào cũng như vậy. Trước đây, các trường không dạy các môn khoa học và toán cho nữ sinh. Năm 1972, một đạo luật có tên Title IX được ban hành tại Mỹ. Luật này giúp nữ sinh có cơ hội bình đẳng trong giáo dục. Từ đó, nam sinh và nữ sinh được học cùng nhau. Gần đây, một số trường học đang xem xét lại việc tách lớp. Nhưng điều này khác với trước đây. Nữ sinh vẫn học các môn giống nam sinh, nhưng họ học mà không có nam sinh trong lớp. Tại sao vậy? Các nhà khoa học biết rằng nam và nữ học theo những cách khác nhau. Họ cũng có cách cư xử khác nhau trong lớp học. Nam sinh thường nói to và tự tin hơn. Họ thích nói và thể hiện những gì mình biết. Trong khi đó, nữ sinh thường trầm lặng hơn. Họ thích lắng nghe và suy nghĩ kỹ trước khi đưa ra câu trả lời. Khi học chung, nam sinh có thể chiếm ưu thế quá nhiều. Ngoài ra, nam và nữ có thể làm phiền nhau. Thay vì tập trung vào bài học, họ nghĩ đến nhau. Trong lớp học tách biệt, họ cư xử tốt hơn và có thể tập trung vào việc học. Một lý do khác để tách lớp là do sở thích của nam và nữ khác nhau. Ví dụ, nam sinh thích những câu chuyện có hành động và phiêu lưu. Trong một lớp tiếng Anh chỉ có nam sinh, giáo viên có thể chọn sách phù hợp với sở thích của họ. Như vậy, họ sẽ hào hứng hơn với bài học. Không phải tất cả các lớp học đều bị tách biệt, chỉ các môn chính như tiếng Anh, toán, khoa học và lịch sử. Tuy nhiên, một số giáo viên cho rằng việc tách lớp không tốt. Họ lo lắng rằng nam sinh và nữ sinh sẽ không học được cách làm việc cùng nhau. Hiện tại, chưa đến 600 trường học đang thử nghiệm mô hình lớp học riêng. Thời gian sẽ trả lời liệu đây có phải là một ý tưởng hay hay chỉ là một phương pháp lỗi thời. Bây giờ bạn sẽ có một chút thời gian để xem lại các câu hỏi từ 26 đến 30. Phần 3, câu hỏi 31-35 Trước tiên, bạn sẽ có một chút thời gian để xem các câu hỏi từ 31 đến 35. Chào mừng các bạn đến với buổi Định hướng Sinh viên Quốc tế tại Norwalk College. Tôi hy vọng các bạn đã có chuyến đi thuận lợi từ quê hương và đang dần ổn định cuộc sống mới. Tôi tin rằng tôi đã gặp tất cả mọi người, nhưng để chắc chắn, tôi là Giám đốc Văn phòng Sinh viên Quốc tế. Tôi là người mà các bạn có thể tìm đến nếu gặp khó khăn với lớp học, nhà ở, hoặc vấn đề thị thực. Các bạn luôn được chào đón ghé thăm văn phòng của tôi. Hôm nay, chúng ta sẽ có một số hội thảo ngắn và thảo luận về những vấn đề chung mà sinh viên quốc tế thường gặp phải. Chủ đề đầu tiên tôi muốn nói đến là giao tiếp, đặc biệt là giao tiếp phi ngôn ngữ. Tất cả các bạn đã học tiếng Anh trong một thời gian. Các bạn có vốn từ vựng tốt, có thể hiểu về thì động từ, câu hỏi, gọi món ăn,… Nhưng giao tiếp không chỉ có lời nói. Một cách khác để giao tiếp là ngôn ngữ cơ thể. Ngôn ngữ cơ thể bao gồm các cử chỉ, nét mặt như cười hay nhăn mặt, cách chúng ta đứng hoặc ngồi, cách chạm vào người khác, cách nhìn vào ai đó. Một số nhà tâm lý học cho rằng hơn 60% giao tiếp của chúng ta thực ra là qua ngôn ngữ cơ thể. Vấn đề là ngôn ngữ cơ thể khác nhau ở mỗi nền văn hóa, và điều này có thể gây hiểu lầm. Ví dụ, ở một số nơi, nhìn thẳng vào mắt người khác khi nói chuyện có thể bị xem là thiếu tôn trọng. Nhưng ở Mỹ, chúng tôi mong đợi điều đó. Nếu một sinh viên quốc tế không nhìn vào mắt bạn khi nói chuyện, người Mỹ có thể nghĩ rằng họ không trung thực. Đây là một trong những hiểu lầm phổ biến trong giao tiếp văn hóa. Bây giờ bạn sẽ có một chút thời gian để xem lại các câu hỏi từ 31 đến 35. Đây là phần kết thúc của Phần 3. Đây là phần kết thúc của bài kiểm tra nghe hiểu.</p>
