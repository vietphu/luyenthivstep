    "reading_text": "Bài đọc\n(A) The blood group system was developed by an Austrian scientist in 1900, and in 1927, Takeji Furukawa, a professor at Tokyo Women's Teacher's School, suggested that personality types and blood groups must be related. He backed it with his own observations, and the theory quickly spread in Japan and beyond. While it wasn't a big hit in the Western world, it is taken very seriously in Japan and some other Asian countries. In fact, there have been cases of discrimination based on blood group in workplaces and schools. The Japanese even have a special term for this type of discrimination—bura hara, or blood type harassment. Here is what this theory suggests.\nBlood Type A Personality\nThese are kind and compassionate individuals who put others' interests and needs before their own. While they may seem calm on the outside, they often suffer from inner anxiety. People with blood type A personality are excellent listeners and make good friends. Although they get along with others quite well, it is often achieved at the expense of their own happiness. To be liked by others, they bottle up their emotions, which takes its toll on their nervous system. It is beneficial for them to take time alone and rest well. The best jobs for this personality type are those that don't require much contact with other people, such as programmers, accountants, or librarians.\nBlood Type B Personality\n(B) Outgoing and friendly, this type is a people person. Unlike type A, type B doesn't do that at the expense of their own feelings; it comes to them naturally, without any effort. Contact with people doesn't wear them out, and they do great as leaders or in any type of job that requires dealing with people. Type B is highly adaptable; they can understand people well. They are into body language and other methods of deciphering others. People with blood type B personality rely on their intuition and trust themselves. Speaking of discrimination, Korean women consider men with blood type B personality unsuitable for marriage due to their playful and flirty disposition.\nBlood Type AB Personality\nFreedom-loving ABs are strong and rational people. They don't worry about little things and can usually assess their life challenges without emotions getting in the way. Despite their love for freedom and independent thinking, they don't have issues when it comes to relationships and are quite popular.\nBlood Type O Personality\nThis type is described as responsible, practical, rule-conscious, and organized. They make excellent leaders, and their determination helps them achieve their goals. While they are usually liked by other people, they are somewhat loners and need a lot of time alone. Typically, type O individuals are physically strong and can find success in sports.",

    "reading_text": "Bài đọc\nPopularized by its inclusion on the typical gap-year agenda for high school students after graduation and regarded as another tick on the CV, volunteering has become a trendy way for wealthy westerners to give back to less fortunate communities. However, despite good intentions from participants, volunteering abroad has attracted substantial criticism over the past few years.\n(A) \"Are the volunteers actually providing any benefits to the destination countries?\" asks Mark Watson, the Executive Director of Tourism Concern, a charity campaigning on ethical tourism issues. More often than not, the answer is unquestionably no.\nThe demand for volunteer spots in developing countries has led to hundreds of commercial volunteering organizations springing up. Many claim to have noble intentions but pocket the money for profit and send volunteers on unsatisfying, purpose-built placements.\n(B) Rather than benefiting local communities, voluntourism can have negative impacts, a number of studies have highlighted. These range from volunteers taking local jobs to child trafficking, where young children are stolen from their families and placed into 'orphanages' to fuel the demand for volunteer placements. These kidnapped children are then subjected to deliberately poor living conditions to elicit higher donations from visiting westerners.\nWhile Watson acknowledges there are companies out there who employ good practices, it's a change in the mindset of would-be volunteers he'd most like to see.\n\"I talk to a lot of people who say they want to dig wells in Africa. I say what Africa has got quite a lot of is unskilled labor; there are a lot of people out there that can dig wells. The idea that you, as an unskilled worker, have got anything really useful that you can add is slightly arrogant and sort of imperialistic in some ways—white people going out to Africa to help the Africans. I think it's mostly about getting people to be realistic; you're just doing it for yourself, it's a holiday. You're not really going to do anything particularly worthwhile, and that's quite a hard message to get across,\" says Watson.\nKate Stefanko, Placement Director at People and Places, agrees to an extent, but she thinks volunteering abroad can be beneficial to all concerned if it is done right. \"We believe that a carefully placed, thoroughly screened, well-prepared, skilled volunteer can—and does—have a positive impact,\" says Stefanko. All volunteers through People and Places have to apply for a position. Then, if accepted, the volunteer is matched with an upcoming project that can benefit from their skill set. As a result, well-run efforts can absolutely develop a level of social interaction and understanding that is profound.",

    "reading_text": "Bài đọc\nBees are an intricate part of the pollination process. Honeybees account for more than 80 percent of the pollination that most vegetables, fruits, and legumes need, the University of Minnesota Extension states on its website. Normally found on spring, summer, and fall blossoms, bees use the nectar and pollen they collect for sustenance and hive warmth. In fact, freezing temperatures kill bees if they don't warm themselves within their hive.\n(A) Bees are cold-blooded; they rely on outside temperatures to regulate their body heat. As a result, honeybees typically emerge from their protective hives during the daytime, commonly between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. They fly only when the air temperature is above 13 to 16 degrees Celsius. Freezing temperatures essentially lock bee muscles in place; their wings cannot beat correctly for proper and safe flight. Being in dropping temperatures causes exposure and normally leads to death. Freezing temperatures also affect nectar viscosity. Even if bees could fly in cold temperatures, flower nectar may be too thick for them to collect or the flowers may be closed in response to the weather.\n(B) A typical beehive maintains an interior temperature of about 33 to 35 degrees Celsius. When freezing temperatures arrive, bees can survive only if they remain inside the hive in a large group, much like penguins huddling together during winter. Clustering, however, does not generate enough heat to combat death from freezing. Bees consume the honey reserves within the hive to create more heat. If bees leave the hive during a cold period, they usually freeze before returning.\n(C) Bees use freezing temperatures to their advantage for hive population control. Specific bees, called drones, are used simply for reproduction; they allow the queen bee to create numerous eggs during the warm months. By autumn, the drones are not needed. Worker bees remove them from the hive. With cold weather setting in, exposed drones freeze, effectively controlling the hive's population. A hive may lose up to one-half of its population during winter months. This constant hive rejuvenation allows the queen to produce more worker bees for increased nectar and pollen collection.\n(D) Your home may have structural cavities that bees find desirable for a hive. If you find a hive hidden in your home's walls, do not attempt to disturb it. Any vibration or disturbance to the colony easily agitates the bees, causing possible stings and major injury or death to humans with allergic reactions. Contact a professional bee removal company. It may be possible for the professionals to use freezing weather as a hive removal strategy. They can open the hive to the freezing elements. That process avoids the use of pesticides and ensures the safety of your home.",

    "reading_text": "Bài đọc\nThe continents may have first risen high above the oceans of the world about 3 billion years ago, researchers say. That's about a billion years earlier than geoscientists had suspected for the emergence of a good chunk of the continents.\nEarth is the only known planet whose surface is divided into continents and oceans. Currently, the continents rise an average of about 2.5 miles (4 kilometers) above the seafloor.\nThe continents are composed of a thick, buoyant crust that's about 21 miles (35 km) deep, on average, whereas the comparatively thin, dense crust of the ocean floor is only an average of about 4 miles (7 km) thick. Because the continents are so thick and buoyant, they are less likely to get dragged downward. That's why so many ancient continental rocks have survived in the Earth's crust. Still, much about the earliest days of the continents, and when and how they formed, remains hotly contested.\n\"Earth's surface is continually being reworked by tectonics and agents of erosion, so what may have formed long ago may no longer be present,\" said geologist Cin-Ty Lee at Rice University in Houston, who was not involved in the current study.\n(A) To shed light on the origins of continents, isotope geochemist Bruno Dhuime at the University of Bristol in England and his colleagues analyzed more than 13,000 samples of rocks from the continental crust. Some of these samples were more than 4 billion years old.\nPrior research suggested the first 2 billion years of Earth's 4.5-billion-year history were dominated by volcanic activity that generated the kind of crust now seen on the seafloor. Continent-like crust, which is thick and rich in silica, was thought to only have emerged in great volumes in the past 2 billion years. Determining what the earliest continental crust was like and when it formed can be tricky, because Earth's crust has melted and mixed together over and over again.\nThe researchers found that when magma cools and crystallizes, the remaining molten rock becomes enriched in silica and rubidium, but less so in strontium. The relative amounts of rubidium and strontium are therefore linked with the amount of silica in rock, and so could be used to extrapolate when in the modern era thick, silica-rich continental crust emerged.\n(B) The researchers found that modern, silica-rich continental crust first appeared about 3 billion years ago. The thick, buoyant nature of these chunks of crust would have made them rise high above what became the seafloor, Dhuime and his colleagues note online June 22 in the journal Nature Geoscience.\n(C) \"They are showing when continents actually emerged from the oceans,\" said Lee, who wrote an accompanying news article in Nature Geoscience. \"Continents certainly existed early in Earth's history, but perhaps many were submerged.\"\nIt remains uncertain why continental crust made its first appearance about 3 billion years ago. One possibility is the onset of plate tectonics—when the plates of rock making up the planet's exterior began moving slowly over the Earth's mantle layer. Plate tectonics would have resulted in wet rock getting shoved down into Earth's interior, eventually helping to form silica-rich magmas that make up much of the continental crust.",

When a species is no longer adapted to a changed environment, it may perish. The exact causes of a species' death vary from situation to situation. Rapid ecological change may render an environment hostile to a species. For example, temperatures may change and a species may not be able to adapt. Food resources may be affected by environmental changes, which will then cause problems for a species requiring these resources. Other species may become better adapted to an environment, resulting in competition and, ultimately, in the death of a species. The fossil record reveals that extinction has occurred throughout the history of Earth. Recent analyses have also revealed that on some occasions many species became extinct at the same time—a mass extinction. One of the best-known examples of mass extinction occurred 65 million years ago with the demise of dinosaurs and many other forms of life.\n(B) Perhaps the largest mass extinction was the one that occurred 225 million years ago, when approximately 95 percent of all species died. Mass extinctions can be caused by a relatively rapid change in the environment and can be worsened by the close interrelationship of many species. If, for example, something were to happen to destroy much of the plankton in the oceans, then the oxygen content of Earth would drop, affecting even organisms not living in the oceans. Such a change would probably lead to a mass extinction.\n(C) One interesting, and controversial, finding is that extinctions during the past 250 million years have tended to be more intense every 26 million years. This periodic extinction might be due to the intersection of the Earth's orbit with a cloud of comets, but this theory is purely speculative. Some researchers have also speculated that extinction may often be random. That is, certain species may be eliminated and others may survive for no particular reason. A species' survival may have nothing to do with its ability or inability to adapt. If so, some of evolutionary history may reflect a sequence of essentially random events.",

    "reading_text": "Bài đọc\n(A) The development of jazz can be seen as part of the larger continuum of American popular music, especially dance music. In the twenties, jazz became the hottest new thing in dance music, much as ragtime had at the turn of the century, and as would rhythm and blues in the fifties, rock in the fifties, and disco in the seventies.\n(B) But two characteristics distinguish jazz from other dance music. The first is improvisation, the changing of a musical phrase according to the player's inspiration. Like all artists, jazz musicians strive for an individual style, and the improvise or paraphrase is a jazz musician's main opportunity to display his or her individuality. In early jazz, musicians often improvised melodies collectively, thus creating a kind of polyphony. There was little soloing as such, although some New Orleans players, particularly cornet player Buddy Bolden, achieved local fame for their ability to improvise a solo. Later the idea of the chorus-long or multichorus solo took hold. Louis Armstrong's instrumental brilliance, demonstrated through extended solos, was a major influence in this development. Even in the early twenties, however, some jazz bands had featured soloists. Similarly, show orchestras and carnival bands often included one or two such \"get-off'' musicians. Unimproved, completely structured jazz does exist, but the ability of the best jazz musicians to create music of great cohesion and beauty during performance has been a hallmark of the music and its major source of inspiration and change.\n(C) The second distinguishing characteristic of jazz is a rhythmic drive that was initially called \"hot\" and later \"swing\". In playing hot, a musician consciously departs from strict meter to create a relaxed sense of phrasing that also emphasizes the underlying rhythms. (\"Rough\" tone and use of moderate vibrato also contributed to a hot sound.) Not all jazz is hot, however, many early bands played unadorned published arrangements of popular songs. Still, the proclivity to play hot distinguished the jazz musician from other instrumentalists.",

    "reading_text": "Bài đọc\n(A) Once upon a time, designers showed new styles and designs to clients through sketches. After the dress was completed, it was displayed on a wooden dummy. Fashion dolls are said to be the first means of circulating the latest dress styles. Fashion dolls were used to show upcoming styles and designs to the customers. The dolls were illustrated with new styles and dressed up with jewellery as well as hair and dress styles.\nCharles Worth, British couturier in Paris, came up with the idea of the living mannequin. When he opened his own store, his wife modelled his creations in the salon. When the idea worked, he employed mannequins who walked about in the salon or down the runway to show his collections to consumers. In early 1911, living models began to be used as a regular part of fashion promotions for retailers as well as manufacturers in the earliest fashion shows. Worth started his own salon in 1858, and in 1911, living models were used.\n(B) Apparel manufacturers need a platform to promote products to the target audience. Fashion shows play a vital role in marketing clothes and conveying recent fashion trends. Nothing is constant in fashion. Designs and styles keep changing. Fashion shows help in creating interest among the public to spread awareness about new arrivals in design and style. These shows help to draw public attention. Fashion marketing scrutinises fashion trends, coordinates sales and promotes goods. It is necessary to grant exposure to various trends and styles of clothing. Fashion marketing is likely to notify the public about recent changing trends and about what is in fashion.\nFashion designers forecast trends. They attend trade shows or visit manufacturers to select fabrics and trims. Designers conduct fittings and adjustments on samples of their designs and the end product is marketed to clothing retailers. Fashion designers aim at inspiring the target audience to purchase the products.\nThrough these shows, fashion designers can express their creative skills and talent in designing various types of clothes. The individual talent of designers is exposed, and they get an opportunity to promote their creations.\nBy participating in these shows, retailers can gain various insights into different designs and styles of clothing from designers. The knowledge gained from these shows helps retailers incorporate ideas into their boutiques. Using the latest fashion software tools, designers can put designs on three-dimensional images.\nEveryone likes to track everyday fashion. Fashion gives designers a chance to be independent in ideas. It boosts confidence in the wearer. Fashion is a form of expression for both the creator and the wearer. It helps people of similar aesthetics to bond.",

    "reading_text": "Bài đọc\n(A) The definition of \"robot\" has been confusing from the very beginning. The word first appeared in 1921, in Karel Capek's play R.U.R., or Rossum's Universal Robots. \"Robot\" comes from the Czech for \"forced labor.\" These robots were more robots in spirit than in form, though. They looked like humans, and instead of being made of metal, they were made of chemical batter. The robots were far more efficient than their human counterparts, and also way more murder-y—they ended up going on a killing spree.\n(B) The real-world definition of \"robot\" is just as ambiguous as those fictional depictions. Ask 10 roboticists and you'll get 10 answers. But they do agree on some general guidelines: A robot is an intelligent, physically embodied machine. A robot can perform tasks autonomously. And a robot can sense and manipulate its environment.\n(C) Modern robots are not unlike toddlers: It's hilarious to watch them fall over, but deep down we know that if we laugh too hard, they might develop a complex and grow up to start World War III. No other human creation inspires such a confusing mix of awe, admiration, and fear: We want robots to make our lives easier and safer, yet we can't quite bring ourselves to trust them. We're crafting them in our own image, yet we are terrified they'll supplant us.\n(D) But such hesitation poses no obstacle to the booming field of robotics. Robots have finally grown smart enough and physically capable enough to make their way out of factories and labs to walk and roll and even leap among us. The machines have arrived. You may be worried a robot is going to steal your job, and we get that. This is capitalism, after all, and automation is inevitable. But you may be more likely to work alongside a robot in the near future than have one replace you. And even better news: You're more likely to make friends with a robot than have one murder you. Hooray for the future!",

    "reading_text": "Bài đọc\n(A) Beads were probably the first durable ornaments humans possessed, and the intimate relationship they had with their owners is reflected in the fact that beads are among the most common items found in ancient archaeological sites. In the past, just as today, men, women, and children adorned themselves with beads. In some cultures still, certain beads are often worn from birth until death, and then are buried with their owners for the afterlife. Abrasion due to daily wear alters the surface features of beads, and if they are buried for long, the effects of corrosion can further change their appearance. Thus, interest is imparted to the bead both by use and the effects of time.\n(B) Besides their wearability, either as jewelry or incorporated into articles of attire, beads possess the desirable characteristics of every collectible: they are durable, portable, available in infinite variety, and often valuable in their original cultural context as well as in today's market. Pleasing to look at and touch, beads come in shapes, colors, and materials that almost compel one to handle them and to sort them.\n(C) Beads are miniature bundles of secrets waiting to be revealed: their history, manufacture, cultural context, economic role, and ornamental use are all points of information one hopes to unravel. Even the most mundane beads may have traveled vast distances and witnessed many human experiences. The bead researcher must gather information from many diverse fields. In addition to having to be a generalist while specializing in what may seem to be a narrow field, the researcher is faced with the problem of primary materials that have little or no documentation. Many ancient beads that are of ethnographic interest have often been separated from their original cultural context.\n(D) Though often regarded as the \"small change of civilizations,\" beads have been a part of every culture, and they can often be used to date archaeological sites and to designate the degree of mercantile, technological, and cultural sophistication.",
